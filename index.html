            During the bootcamp, bootcampers were tasked with completing a group project. I had to make sure they understand how read and run unit tests, I had to make sure they know what is expected of them and understand what they need to do, answer any quries that they might have, and check up on them to see if they might need any assistance.

            I was responsible for any technicalities that may come up for a bootcamper In Wethinkcode_. These technicalities may include but not limited to, issues with the machine they are working, replacing hardware should it need to be replaced, making sure that there is not cheating, explaining to bootcampers concepts that they might find difficult and recommending bootcampers that have technical ability and are a fit the wethinkcode culture.
